__________________SQL_________________
i. Also known as SEQUEL (Structured English QUEry Language)
ii. Structured Query Language.
iii. SQL can be written in both, capital and small letter SQL is not a case sensitive language.
This language is used for database management system (DBMS)
Creatin our first Database
1. CREATE DATABASE dataBaseName; //this command will create a new database.
2. DROP DATABASE dataBaseName; //this command will delete the database
3. USE dataBaseName; // this command will work on those database on which we want some changes i.e Table creation, Changes in table data, also view data from table
4. General Form of Table:
 USE dataBaseName;
	CREATE TABLE tableName(
	colum1Name datatype constraints,
	colum2ame datatype constraints,
	colum3ame datatype constraints 
);

5. Table Creation of three column =|id|Name|Age|
Code=>	USE dataBaseName;
	CREATE TABLE Student(
		id INT PRIMARY KEY,
		name VARCHAR(50),
		age INT NOT NULL
);

6.Insertion of data into table
				(id, Name, Age)
Code=>	INSERT INTO Student VALUES(1, "Salman", 20);
	INSERT INTO Student VALUES(2,"Professor", 21);

7. SELECT * FROM  Student; //To print table on screen

8. SIGNED mean an integer with positive or negative value.

9. Normally we can store -128 to 127 numbers in TINYINT but if write TINYINT UNSIGNED it will change the range from 0 to 255


____Types of SQL commands___
1. DDL (Data Definition Language): create, rename, drop, alter, truncate
2. DQL (Data Query Language): select
3. DML (Data Manipulation Language): insert, update & delete
4. DCL (Data Control Language): grant & revoke permission to user
5. TCL (Transaction Control Language): start transaction, commit, rollback


_____Database related Queries_______
1. CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dataBaseName; //This command will give us a warning if there is another Database exists on the same name. if not exists then simple it will create a new database on the given name.

2. DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS dataBaseName; //this command will first check the database if exists then it will be deleted and if not exists then it will show us a warning.

3. SHOW DATABASES; // To view a list of all Databases that created.

4. SHOW TABLES; //To view all the table that created.


__________Table related Queries________
1. Table Creation of three column =|rollno|Name|Age|
Code=>	USE dataBaseName;
	CREATE TABLE Student(
		rollno INT PRIMARY KEY,
		name VARCHAR(50),
		age INT NOT NULL
);
 
2. SELECT * FROM  Student; //To print table on screen. * it mean all

3. Insertion of data into table:
	INSERT INTO Student VALUES(rollno, Name, Age); //this command will insert first three columns of rollno, name & age.
Code=>	INSERT INTO Student VALUES(1, "Salman", 20); //This will insert data of first student in a row. for insertion of data the order is must to follow
	INSERT INTO Student VALUES(2,"Professor", 21);


__________KEYS_____________
1. Primary Key
2. Foreign Key

1. Primary Key:(main key) it should be unique,
	it is a column or set of column in a table that uniquely identifies each row (a unique id)
there is only 1 Primary Key & it should be NOT null.

2. Foreign Key:
	A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refer to the primary key in other table. 
there can be multiples Foreign Keys.
Foreign Keys can have duplicate & null values.

____________Constraints__________
	SQL Constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table.
1. NOT NULL	//columns cannot have a null value 
	colum1 int NOT NULL

2. UNIQUE //all values in column are different
	colum2 int UNIQUE
	cnic INT UNIQUE,

3. PIMARY KEY //makes a column unique & not null but used only for one
	id int PRIMARY KEY
